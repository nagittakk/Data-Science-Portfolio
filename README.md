This project underscores the utilization of .txt files for seamless storage and updating of task-related information directly on the computer, ensuring streamlined team coordination and productivity.
       
III: Task management program (modified) - Enhanced task management program integrating Python functions to enhance code modularity.
       
IV: Inventory management program - This program for a shoe store, allows users to update and access inventory data seamlessly. This project leverages object-oriented programming principles, enabling efficient organization and manipulation of inventory items. The program streamlines inventory management with user-friendly interfaces, boosting operational efficiency
       
V: Exercise and Research - Task 1 - Proposing an NLP model type that aligns with a provided task description. Task 2 - A concise overview of innovative technology utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), along with an explanation of how the technology operates.

- Data Analytics & Exploration (3):

I: Databases - A user-friendly program for querying a HyperionDev-based database with the flexibility to select specific fields for display. After each query, users are prompted to save the results in either XML or JSON format, with the ability to customize the filename. This project aims to streamline database interactions and enhance data management capabilities for users.
        
II: Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 'movies' and 'automobile' datasets. These analyses included generating visualizations, investigating various aspects of the datasets, and documenting findings. Through this project, insights into the 'movies' and 'automobile' datasets's characteristics, trends, and patterns were uncovered and explained in detail.
        
III: Data Visualisation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 'wine' dataset. This analysis includes generating visualizations, investigating various aspects of the dataset, and documenting findings. Through this project, insights into the 'wine' dataset's characteristics, trends, and patterns will be uncovered and explained in detail.

- Machine Learning & AI (3):

I: Image Processing
Exploring the 'MNIST' dataset to develop a random forests model. This model aims to perform operations on image data to enhance clarity and improve image quality. Through this project, we seek to leverage machine learning to refine image processing, particularly for handwritten digit recognition.
         
II: Unsupervised Machine Learning
An extensive Principal Component Analysis (PCA) report on the 'USArrests' dataset, aiming to explore its nuances comprehensively. Additionally, the project includes applying two clustering techniques - the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method and hierarchical clustering - and analyzing the clusters they generate. Through this multifaceted analysis, the project aims to uncover insights into the dataset's structure and patterns while demonstrating proficiency in PCA and clustering methodologies
